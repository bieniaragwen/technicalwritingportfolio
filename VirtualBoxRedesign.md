# Oracle VM VirtualBox Documentation Re-design

## Summary 

In this example, I have recontextualized Oracle VM VirtualBox's documentation site into a knowledge base website. In its current state, the documentation is poorly written, organized, and information is difficult to find. 

## Before
The current documentation site contains an outdated navigation system, making it difficult for readers to find the information they are looking for.
