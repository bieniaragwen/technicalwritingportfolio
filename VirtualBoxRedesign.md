# Oracle VM VirtualBox Documentation Re-design

## Problem Statement 

Oracle VM VirtualBox's documentation site is poorly written, disorganized, and information is difficult to find. The pre-existing documentation is inconsistent and hard to access for users of all skill levels. In order to improve the user experience of all users who require information about VirutalBox, I have created a full website redesign prototype with clickable wireframes in the style of a knowledge base system.

## Before
The current documentation site contains an outdated navigation system, making it difficult for readers to find the information they are looking for.

## Solution 

Develop a knowledge base website for VirtualBox's documentation to showcase how a knowledge management system could improve the user experience.
